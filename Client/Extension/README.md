ToDo
----

To actually implement at all
----------------------------
	Default values (or lack thereof) for the settings are not handled properly - see below?
	Background process not currently implemented - needs merging with main.js?
		Notification Icons
		Save per browser session etc
	Move the Button to the correct place?! (and move popup too)

To Check is implemented correctly
---------------------------------

	Is it possible to setup a port between the popup and the
		content script directly without main.js proxying
	Popup is displayed unattached?
	CORS issues - are these fixed correctly?
	Saving Configuration - is this implemented correctly for an addon?
